# Rock-Paper-Scissors game

[The project is in the context of my postgraduate program(Web and Data science) based on the famous game rock-paper-scissors. The aim of this project is to create a game app that two agents will play against each other. Our agent is trying to detect an image with noise which have been picked by the another agent and then tries to pick the right move in order to win the round. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) which is a type of Deep Learning neural network architecture commonly used in Computer Vision.]

## Overview

[The dataset that our model is trained contains 2188 images of hand gestures of each class (rock-paper-scissors). The dataset is imported as zip file and then you can extract it into different folders depending on the project requirements. The images in the dataset are 300x200 pixel size in PNG format. You can download it directly from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors).]

## Getting Started

[The app is written on google colab notebook or you can choose any other notebook. The libraries that need to imported are:]

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Splitfolders
- PIL
- Sklearn
- Random
- Cv2
- Zipfile, Os

And for deep learning libraries:
- Tensorflow
- Keras

## Training the Neural Network

[If applicable, provide instructions on how to train the neural network. Include details about the dataset used, training parameters, and any other relevant information.]

## Model Evaluation

[Explain how users can evaluate the performance of the trained model. Include information about metrics used, testing datasets, and any other relevant details.]

## Results

[Share the results of your project. This may include performance metrics, visualizations, or any other relevant output.]

## Project Structure

[Provide an overview of the project structure. Explain the purpose of key directories and files.]
